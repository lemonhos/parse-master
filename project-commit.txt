Initial level commitment (80%, 90%, or 100%): 100%

Tutorial time that at least one and ideally all members will guarantee to attend
each week: Monday 11am. 

3+ hours weekly that the group guarantees EACH OTHER to be available
to meet (ideally face-to-face): Wednesday 6pm - 9pm

Three one-sentence ideas the team might pursue for the project. Note:
Each idea should be plausible enough to show that the group has done
some thought and reading about it. Each should have the potential to
develop into a real project. Together, they should explore some
meaningfully distinct project options (so, not just three variations
on the same project).

1. A parser-generator for EBNF definitions, done in Dr.Racket, along with a user-input driven interpreter generator to pair with the parser. 

2. Authentication protocols - fixing known issues in a well known protocol, illustrating how the fix is implemented and the advantages of the changes. 

3. Computational graph generator supporting dynamic graphs, with specific graph-folding operations and runtime graph resizing, done in racket or some lisp-style language and with applications to deep learning structures.
